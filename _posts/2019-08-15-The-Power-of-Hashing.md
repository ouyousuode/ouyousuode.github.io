title: The Power of Hashing

{{page.title}}
===============================

<font face="Monospace">Hash functions are used everywhere in computing.Originally,hashing was invented to store and look up elements in computer memory.We think of a hash function as a random function,assigning random hash values to elements;thus if we use hash values to place elements in computer memory then we expect them to spread out nicely.At the same time,the hash function has to be fixed as soon as we start using it;otherwise can't find the elements again.</font>
