{{page.title}}
=============================

一篇可以4分钟读完的精彩博文，其原文[Ten Principles for Growth as an Engineer](https://medium.com/@daniel.heller/ten-principles-for-growth-69015e08c35b)也在**Medium**，基于此，将原文附于文末。是好内容，自当“奇文共欣赏，疑义相与析”。作者Dan Heller近期还出了本书《Building a Career in Software: A Comprehensive Guide to Success in the Software Industry》,基于作者的实战背景，可能的话，可以买一本来翻翻。<br/>

首先，看看作者的介绍，Dan Heller is a Staff Software Engineer in Infrastructure at **Uber**.In earlier lives, he has led reliability efforts on Uber Eats,built monitoring systems at AppDynamics, helped port iOS to the ARM64 architecture as a **Kernel Engineer at Apple**, directed the responses to dozens of high-stakes production outages, and managed teams of up to 25 engineers.<br/>
