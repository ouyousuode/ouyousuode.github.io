===================================

“干脆连Emacs也别用，用Vim好了”，此直接引发程序员文本编辑器选择之战！
``` Objective-C
Winnie:I do use Vim over Emacs

Richard:Oh,God,help us ! Okay,uh...you know what ? I just...
I don't think this is going to work.I'm sorry.Uh,I mean like,
what,we're going to bring kids into this world with that over 
their heads ? That's not really fair to them,don't you think ?

Winnie:Kids ? We haven't even slept together.

Richard:And guess what,it's never going to happen now...

Winnie is a Facebook engineer.And when she was at MIT,she
did her master's thesis on game playing AIs.She did a lot
of machine learning stuff! .. train a convolutional net 
to play Atari 2600 games.
```
坚持自身的选择，是要付出代价的；而且此情境中的代价是惨重的；以至，Richard觉得“两人永远都不会滚床单了！”；唉，真是何必呢？那么，GNU Emacs究竟是何方神器，竟有如此大之吸引力...
