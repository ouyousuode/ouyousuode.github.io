====================

观影过后，无论该影片是改编自名著、当代畅销书、真人真事、抑或编剧从0打造，可能总有几句台词，值得反复琢磨，比如：<br/>

#### 《决胜21点》(21: Blackjack)
Prof Mickey: We're gonna call this game show host problem, all right? Ben, suppose you're on a game show. And you are given a chance to choose from three different doors, all right? Now, behind one of the door is a new car. Behind the other two, goats. Which door would you choose, Ben? (我们把这个游戏称为节目主持人难题吧。本，假设你正参加一个游戏节目。你有机会从三扇不同的门里选择一扇，其中一扇门后🈶️一辆新车，而另两扇后面各有一头山羊。本，你要选择哪扇呢？) <br/>

Student Ben: Door number one.(1号门)<br/>

Prof Mickey: Ben chooses door number one. All right, now, the game show host, who, by the way, knows what's behind all the other doors, decides to open another door. Let's say he chooses door number three. Behind which sits a goat. Now, Ben, game show host comes up to you. He says, "Ben, do you want to stay with door number one or go with door number two ? " Now, is it your interest to switch your choice ? (本选择了1号门。顺便提一句，主持人知道门后的秘密，这时，他决定打开另一扇门，比如他打开了3号门，结果门后是一头山羊。现在，主持人向你走来，他说「本，你想坚持选择1号门呢，还是想换成2号门。」现在的问题是，改变选择是否对你有利？)<br/>

Student Ben: Yeah.(是的，改变选择)<br/>

Prof Mickey: Well, wait. Remember, the host knows where the car is, so how do you know he's not playing a trick on you ? Trying to use reverse psychology to get you to pick a goat ? (等一下，记住，主持人知道那辆车在哪里，那么，你如何判断他是否在耍你？或许他利用逆反心理诱使你选择一头山羊？)<br/>

Student Ben: Well, I wouldn't really care. I mean, may answer's based on **statistics**. Based on variable change.(我并不介意，因为我的答案是基于**统计学**;基于变量变化。)<br/>

Prof Mickey: Variable change ? But he just asked you a simple question.(变量变化？但他只不过问了个简单的问题。)<br/>

Student Ben: Yeah, which changed everything.(是的，但是这一问改变了所有)<br/>

Prof Mickey: Enlighten us.(来，给我们开开窍。)<br/>

Student Ben: Well, when I was originally asked to choose a door, I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right. But after he opens one of the doors and then re-offers me the choice, it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch. So, yeah, I'll take door number two, and thank you for that extra 33.3%.(当一开始，他让我选择一扇门时，我有33.3%的几率选对。但当他打开了其中一扇门，然后又让我选时；现在，如果我选择换一扇门，选对的几率是66.7%。那我当然选2号门，并且谢谢你多给我33.3%的机会。)<br/>

Prof Mickey: Exactly. People, remember, if you don't know which door to open, always account for variable change. Now, see, most people wouldn't take the switch out of paranoia, fear, emotions. But Mr Campbell, he kept emotions aside and let simple **math** get his ass into a brand-new car ! (完全正确！大家记住，如果你不知道选哪扇门的话，永远要记得考虑变量的变化。这种情况下，因为偏执,恐惧和感情用事，大部分人都不会改变选择。但是，坎贝尔先生把感情放在了一边，让简单的数学知识为他挣得了一辆崭新的汽车！)<br/>

#### 《永无止境》(Limitless)
Against aggressive over-expanion? There aren't. Because there are no safeguards in human nature. We're wired to overreach. Look at history, all the countries that ever ruled the world. Portugal with this big massive navy. All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms. And the Brits? Now they're just sitting on a dank little island fussing over their suits.<br/>

No one's stopping and thinking,“Hey,we're doing pretty well. We got France, we got Poland, we got a big Swiss bank account. You know what? Let's not invade Russia in the winter. Let's go home, let's pop a beer, and let's live off the interest.”<br/>

#### 《点球成金》(Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game)   
There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what is really happening.And this leads people who run Major League Baseball teams to misjudge their player and mismanage their teams.People who run ball clubs,they think in terms of buying players.Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.<br/>

Your goal should be to buy wins.And in order to buy wins,you need to buy runs.Baseball thinking is medieval.They are asking all the wrong questions.<br/>

This is a code that I've written for our year-to-year projections.This is building in the intelligence that we have to project players.It's about getting things down to one number.Using the stats the way we read them,we'll find value in players that nobody else can see.<br/>

People are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws. Age, appearance, personality. Bill James and mathematics cut straight through that. Billy, of the 20,000 notable players for us to consider, I believe that there is a championship team of 25 people that we can afford, because everyone else in baseball undervalues them.<br/>

#### 《华尔街之狼》(The Wolf of Wall Street)
The money does not just buy you a better life.Better food,better car,better person.It also makes you a better person.You can give generously to the church or the political party of your choice.You can save the fucking spotted owl with money.I always wanted to be rich.<br/>

Let me tell you something.There is no nobility in poverty.I've been a rich man,and I've been a poor man,and I choose to rich every fucking time ! 'Coz at least as a rich man,when I have to face my problems,I show up in the back of the limo.Wearing $2000 suite,and $14000 gold fucking watch.If there anyone here thinks I am superficial of materialistic.Go get a job in fucking McDonalds,'cause that's where you fucking belong !<br/> 

But before you depart this roomful of winners..I want you to take a good look at the person next you,go on.'Cause sometime in not so distant future.You know,you pulled out to a red light and you beat-up old fucking Pinto and that person gonna be pulling up right along side you in the brand new Porsche.With their beautiful wife by their side,who's got big full up juiced tits.And who will you be next to ?Some disgusting wildebeast with 3 days of razorstubble in a sleeveless moo-moo,crammed in the next you with a carload of groceries from the fucking price club ! And that's who you're gonna be sitting next to!...<br/>

I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich !

《永无止境》对应台词的大体意思：能抑制过度扩张？不会的，人常常失去分寸，不自量力。看看曾称霸一时的国家吧...没人会知足。有了大片土地、大笔钱财也不满足。非要在冬天去攻打俄国...没人想靠利息来生活。 ——》讲人性的弱点<br/>

《点球成金》台词大意：经营球队的人想的都是怎么买球员，目标不应该是买球员，而是买到胜利...棒球界的理念很原始，研究的方向都是错误的...由于偏见，大家太重视各种约定成俗的偏见。年龄、外貌以及性格，而比尔和数学完全跳过了这些...<br/>

摆脱已有的规则束缚，利用与众不同的视角重新解读现存的信息就能看到别人看不到的价值。似田忌赛马，通过重新解读，在整体资源处于劣势的情况下，创造出了局部的优势，进而有机会取得了整场战役的胜利。所以，台版译文《魔球：逆境中致胜的智慧》，很是贴切。<br/>

《华尔街之狼》大意：钱不仅能帮你买到更好的生活、更好的食物、更好的车，还能帮你成为更好的人。你可以随心所欲地大肆捐钱给自己喜欢的教堂或政党...这世上，做穷人不光彩。我富过，也穷过，但每一次我都会选择做富人。因为至少有钱时，就算面对困难，我也是坐在豪车后座。如果有人觉得我肤浅或崇尚物质，那就去麦当劳找工作吧，因为那才是你的归属！付不起信用卡账单了吗？去赚钱吧！要被房东扫地出门了吗？去赚钱吧！你女朋友觉得你是个没用的loser吗？去赚钱吧！我想要让你们用钱解决一切问题！ ——》末尾一句，表明了对孔方兄的态度，钱是工具！<br/>

#### 《美丽心灵》(A Beautiful Mind)
A blonde and her friends come.Recall the lessons of Adam Smith,the father of modern economics,'In competition,individual ambition serves the common good.'Exactly.Every man for himself,gentlemen.And those who strike out are stuck with her friends.<br/>

If we all go for the blonde,we block each other.Not a single one of us is gonna get her.So then we go for her friends,but they will all give us the cold shoulder...because nobody likes to be second choice.Well,what if no one goes for the blonde? We don't get in each other's way,and we don't insult the other girls.That's the only way we win.That's the only way we all get laid.<br/>

Adam Smith said,the best result comes from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself,right ? Right,but **Incomplete**.Because the best result will come from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself and the group...Governing dynamics.Adam Smith was wrong.<br/>

场景：一位美女和她的(姿色普通)朋友们到咖啡馆了，纳什的同学开始谈论如何约到这位美女。回想亚当•斯密,现代经济学之父那课，‘在竞争中，个人的雄心是为了公共的利益’。完全正确。先生们，人人都为自己，那些受打击者就和她的朋友在一起。<br/>

如果我们全都去追美女，我们只会相互勾心斗角，却没有人能得到她。如果我们接着去追她的朋友们，她们肯定会非常冷淡，因为没有人愿意做她人的替代者。但是，如果我们都不去找那位美女，我们就不会阻挠彼此，也不会因此冒犯其他的女孩。这是我们唯一能全胜的办法，也是我们唯一全都能得到女伴的方法。<br/>

亚当•斯密说过，最好的结果来自于‘群体里的每一个人都只做对他个人有利的事’，对吧？没错，但**不完整**。因为最好的结果来自于‘群体里的每一个人都只做对自己有利并且对群体也有利的事’...亚当•斯密是错的！——》结果就是，1950年，22岁的John Nash在普林斯顿大学以Non-cooperative Games为题的**27**页博士论文毕业。<br/>

#### 《茉莉的牌局》(Molly's Game)
People have asked me what my goal was at that point,what was my endgame.Back then,I would've laughed at the question.I was raised to be a champion.My goal was to win.At what and against whom ? Those were just details.<br/>

My game had a tricky ecosystem.These guys could buy anything but here in this room you couldn't buy your win.You couldn't buy me,you couldn't buy the girls and you couldn't buy a seat at the table.There's nothing as sweet as a win you have to work for.And the wins and losses were compelling and they were real.Of course it helped that the players were gambling addicts. <br/>

It had to end sometime.I just thought it would be on my time.The game had given me an identity,respect,and a defined place in a world that was inaccessible and in one irrational heartbeat it was taken away.I was irrelevant and forgotten overnight.<br/>

It'd been two weeks since I lost the game and I made an appointment to see someone because now the humiliation and depression had given away to blinding anger at my powerlessness over the unfair whims of men.**It was that there weren't any rule.**These power moves weren't framed by right and wrong,just ego and vanity.Selfish whims with no regard for consequence.**No fairness,no justice.**And that giggling,cacking call from Player X.'**You are so fucked.**'I couldn't lose to that green-screened little shit and I didn't want a therapist to make me feel okay about it.**You know what makes me feel okay about losing ? Winning.** <br/>

有人曾经问我「在那时我的目标是什么，我将会在何时结束这份工作」。在当时，我会嘲笑这个问题。我被鼓励去成为一名冠军。**我的目标就是赢**。至于在哪赢，以及赢得谁？这些只是小细节。<br/>

我的牌局里的人鱼龙混杂。他们能买到任何东西，但在这个房间里，你买不到胜利。你买不到我，你也买不到(其他)女孩(服务人员)，你甚至买不到参加游戏的资格。没什么比自己挣来的胜利更美好了。输与赢都很有吸引力，而且很真实。当然，如果玩家有赌瘾就更好了。<br/>

这牌局不可能长久地经营下去。只不过我认为「何时收手能由我来定」。这牌局给了我身份,尊重,和一个在我曾难以企及的社交圈中为圈内人所认可的地位，而这些在一瞬间均化为泡影。我一夜之间变成了没人在意的无名小卒。<br/>

牌局经营失败已是两周前的事了。我预约了一位心理医生，因为那时的屈辱感和失落感已被一种莫名的愤怒所取代;愤怒是因为男人可以为所欲为，而我却无能为力。**我认识到世间本无规则而言**。他们的权力得以行使并非因为对或错，不过是他们的自负和虚荣心使然罢了。他们恣意妄为，不顾后果。一切都毫无公平与公正可言。更为可恶的，还有X玩家打来的那通充满贱笑的电话，「你是真废了！」我才不想在那个贱男人面前认输呢，更不想按心理医生要求的那样去放下。你知道「在失败时，我怎样才能舒心吗？」**去赢回来**！

#### 《金爆内幕》(Gold)
The only truth here is, when everybody's getting rich, nobody gives a shit about the truth. Come the fuck on. All anyone had to do was look, open their eyes. Man the-the gold was wrong, the find was too good. There were red flags everywhere. Why did no one look ? 'Cause on one wanted to fucking know. We all wanted to believe. Me,you,fucking everybody. Why ? Because we were all making so much fucking money,man. That's the truth. That's been going on for fucking centuries.<br/>

唯一的真相是，只要能发财，没人在乎真相是什么。拜托，人们只需要仔细看看，睁开眼看看。样品中的金子是错的，金矿储量又过于巨大。有太多的疑点。为什么没人仔细看呢？因为没人想知道发生的事情。我们都愿意相信。你,我，所有人.为什么呢？因为我们都认为能发大财。这就是真相！千百年来一直如此。<br/>

#### 《绅士追杀令》(The Gentlemen)
There's only one rule in this fucking jungle. When the lion's hungry, he eats.<br/>
这个丛林中只有他妈的一条法则，「狮子饿了，就会大开杀戒」。<br/>
If you wish to be the king of the jungle, it's not enough to act like a king. You must be the king. And there can be no doubt. Because doubt causes chaos and one's own demise. My queen told me that.<br/>

如果你要当丛林之王，做做样子是不够的。你必须成为真正的王者。不能迟疑。因为迟则生乱，更会身死！我的皇后告诉我的。<br/>
