====================

观影过后，无论此影片是改编自名著、当代畅销书、真人真事、抑或其它，可能总有几句台词，值得反复琢磨，比如：

#### 《永无止境》(《Limitless》) 
Against aggressive over-expanion? There aren't.Because there are no safeguards in human nature.We're wired to overreach.Look at history,all the countries that ever ruled the world.Portugal with this big massive navy.All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms.And the Brits? Now they're just sitting on a dank little island fussing over their suits.

No one's stopping and thinking,"Hey,we're doing pretty well.We got France,we got Poland,we got a big Swiss bank account.You know what? Let's not invade Russia in the winter.Let's go home,let's pop a beer,and let's live off the interest."

#### 《点球成金》(《Moneyball:The Art of Winning an Unfair Game》)   
There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what is really happening.And this leads people who run Major League Baseball teams to misjudge their player and mismanage their teams.People who run ball clubs,they think in terms of buying players.Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.

Your goal should be to buy wins.And in order to buy wins,you need to buy runs.Baseball thinking is medieval.They are asking all the wrong questions.

This is a code that I've written for our year-to-year projections.This is building in the intelligence that we have to project players.It's about getting things down to one number.Using the stats the way we read them,we'll find value in players that nobody else can see.

People are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws.Age,appearance,personality.Bill James and mathematics cut straight through that.Billy,of the 20,000 notable players for us to consider,I believe that there is a championship team of 25 people that we can afford,because everyone else in baseball undervalues them.

#### 《华尔街之狼》(《The Wolf of Wall Street》) 
The money does not just buy you a better life.Better food,better car,better person.It also makes you a better person.You can give generously to the church or the political party of your choice.You can save the fucking spotted owl with money.I always wanted to be rich.

Let me tell you something.There is no nobility in poverty.I've been a rich man,and I've been a poor man,and I choose to rich every fucking time ! 'Coz at least as a rich man,when I have to face my problems,I show up in the back of the limo.Wearing $2000 suite,and $14000 gold fucking watch.If there anyone here thinks I am superficial of materialistic.Go get a job in fucking McDonalds,'cause that's where you fucking belong ! 

But before you depart this roomful of winners..I want you to take a good look at the person next you,go on.'Cause sometime in not so distant future.You know,you pulled out to a red light and you beat-up old fucking Pinto and that person gonna be pulling up right along side you in the brand new Porsche.With their beautiful wife by their side,who's got big full up juiced tits.And who will you be next to ?Some disgusting wildebeast with 3 days of razorstubble in a sleeveless moo-moo,crammed in the next you with a carload of groceries from the fucking price club ! And that's who you're gonna be sitting next to!...

I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich !

《永无止境》对应台词的大体意思：能抑制过度扩张？不会的，人常常失去分寸，不自量力。看看曾称霸一时的国家吧...没人会知足。有了大片土地、大笔钱财也不满足。非要在冬天去攻打俄国...没人想靠利息来生活。 ——》讲人性的弱点

《点球成金》台词大意：经营球队的人想的都是怎么买球员，目标不应该是买球员，而是买到胜利...棒球界的理念很原始，研究的方向都是错误的...由于偏见，大家太重视各种约定成俗的偏见。年龄、外貌以及性格，而比尔和数学完全跳过了这些...

摆脱已有的规则束缚，利用与众不同的视角重新解读现存的信息就能看到别人看不到的价值。似田忌赛马，通过重新解读，在整体资源处于劣势的情况下，创造出了局部的优势，进而有机会取得了整场战役的胜利。所以，台版译文《魔球：逆境中致胜的智慧》，很是贴切。

《华尔街之狼》大意：钱不仅能帮你买到更好的生活、更好的食物、更好的车，还能帮你成为更好的人。你可以随心所欲地大肆捐钱给自己喜欢的教堂或政党...这世上，做穷人不光彩。我富过，也穷过，但每一次我都会选择做富人。因为至少有钱时，就算面对困难，我也是坐在豪车后座。如果有人觉得我肤浅或崇尚物质，那就去麦当劳找工作吧，因为那才是你的归属！付不起信用卡账单了吗？去赚钱吧！要被房东扫地出门了吗？去赚钱吧！你女朋友觉得你是个没用的loser吗？去赚钱吧！我想要让你们用钱解决一切问题！ ——》末尾一句，表明了对孔方兄的态度，钱是工具！
