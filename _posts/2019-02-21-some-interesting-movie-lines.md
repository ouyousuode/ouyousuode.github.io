====================

观影过后，无论此影片是改编自名著、当代畅销书、真人真事、抑或其它，可能总有几句台词，值得反复琢磨，比如：

#### 《永无止境》(《Limitless》) 
Against aggressive over-expanion? There aren't.Because there are no safeguards in human nature.We're wired to overreach.Look at history,all the countries that ever ruled the world.Portugal with this big massive navy.All they got now are salt cod and cheap condoms.And the Brits? Now they're just sitting on a dank little island fussing over their suits.

No one's stopping and thinking,"Hey,we're doing pretty well.We got France,we got Poland,we got a big Swiss bank account.You know what? Let's not invade Russia in the winter.Let's go home,let's pop a beer,and let's live off the interest."

#### 《点球成金》(《Moneyball:The Art of Winning an Unfair Game》)   
There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what is really happening.And this leads people who run Major League Baseball teams to misjudge their player and mismanage their teams.People who run ball clubs,they think in terms of buying players.Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.

Your goal should be to buy wins.And in order to buy wins,you need to buy runs.Baseball thinking is medieval.They are asking all the wrong questions.

This is a code that I've written for our year-to-year projections.This is building in the intelligence that we have to project players.It's about getting things down to one number.Using the stats the way we read them,we'll find value in players that nobody else can see.

People are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws.Age,appearance,personality.Bill James and mathematics cut straight through that.Billy,of the 20,000 notable players for us to consider,I believe that there is a championship team of 25 people that we can afford,because everyone else in baseball undervalues them.

#### 《华尔街之狼》(《The Wolf of Wall Street》) 
The money does not just buy you a better life.Better food,better car,better person.It also makes you a better person.You can give generously to the church or the political party of your choice.You can save the fucking spotted owl with money.I always wanted to be rich.

Let me tell you something.There is no nobility in poverty.I've been a rich man,and I've been a poor man,and I choose to rich every fucking time ! 'Coz at least as a rich man,when I have to face my problems,I show up in the back of the limo.Wearing $2000 suite,and $14000 gold fucking watch.If there anyone here thinks I am superficial of materialistic.Go get a job in fucking McDonalds,'cause that's where you fucking belong ! 

But before you depart this roomful of winners..I want you to take a good look at the person next you,go on.'Cause sometime in not so distant future.You know,you pulled out to a red light and you beat-up old fucking Pinto and that person gonna be pulling up right along side you in the brand new Porsche.With their beautiful wife by their side,who's got big full up juiced tits.And who will you be next to ?Some disgusting wildebeast with 3 days of razorstubble in a sleeveless moo-moo,crammed in the next you with a carload of groceries from the fucking price club ! And that's who you're gonna be sitting next to!...

I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich !
